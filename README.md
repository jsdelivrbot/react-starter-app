# React Starter Video Web Application

This is my first web application built with React as a part of Stephen Grider's [Modern React with Redux Course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/), which is great for learning React and some JavaScript ES6.

**Note:** I do not own any of the contents provided by this web application. Videos are all sourced from YouTube API, and the logo is just a modified YouTube logo. This is a personal project and will not be commercialized in anyway.

### Getting Started
